Summary: Implement Options Pricing Model (Black-Scholes)
Status: Open
Priority: Medium
Assignee: quant_dev_1
Description:
We need to implement a standard pricing model for the new Option securities.
Currently, the system accepts manual price updates, but we need theoretical values for risk estimation.

Requirements:
- Implement Black-Scholes-Merton formula in `com.trading.dummy.analytics`.
- Support Call and Put pricing.
- Inputs needed: Underlying Price, Strike, Time to Expiry, Risk-Free Rate, Volatility.
- Update `SimplePricer` to use this for theoretical val if market data is stale.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Unit tests validating calculation against known values.
- Integration with the Margin Service for "haircut" calculation on options.
