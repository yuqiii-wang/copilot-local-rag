Key: SEC-99
Type: Task
Summary: Security Audit for API Endpoints
Status: Review
Priority: High
Description:
The internal audit team flagged that `TradingSystem.placeOrder` does not validate the `userId` in the context.
Basically, anyone can place an order for any account if they know the text ID.

Remediation:
- Implement a `UserContext` object.
- Validates that `UserContext.acl` contains generic "WRITE" permission for `Portfolio.id`.
- Log all unauthorized attempts as SECURITY_AUDIT events.
