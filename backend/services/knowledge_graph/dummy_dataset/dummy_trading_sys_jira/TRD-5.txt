Summary: Core Execution Engine Logic
Status: In Progress
Assignee: Tech Lead
Description:
The heart of the system.
Need a class `ExecutionEngine` that connects everything.

Flow:
1. Receive Order.
2. Validate Order parameters.
3. Check Market Price (via Pricer).
4. Check Pre-trade Risk (via RiskManager).
5. Execute (Simulate fill).
6. Update Portfolio.

Constraint:
- For now, simulate fills against a static/simple MarketData provider.
- Market Orders fill at current Ask/Bid.
- Limit Orders fill only if price crosses.

Current Implementation:
- Basic flow is working.
- Need to integrate RiskManager call (Dependence on RSK-2).
