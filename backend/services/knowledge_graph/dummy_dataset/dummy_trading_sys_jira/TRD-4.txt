Summary: Portfolio and Position Management
Status: Done
Assignee: John Doe
Description:
As a system, we need to track what we own.
Implement Position and Portfolio classes.

Logic:
- Portfolio holds a Map of Symbol -> Position.
- Position tracks quantity, average cost, and realized PnL.
- Update Position on Trade event.
- Calculate Average Cost on BUY.
- Calculate Realized PnL on SELL.

Comments:
[Jane] - Watch out for partial fills updating the position correctly.
[John] - Handled update method in Position.java. PnL calc is simplified for now (FIFO vs Weighted Avg needs discussion, used Avg for now).
