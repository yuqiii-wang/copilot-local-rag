Key: FUT-402
Type: Story
Summary: Futures Expiration and Settlement Logic
Status: To Do
Priority: High
Description:
Futures contracts (e.g., ES-DEC24) have specific expiration dates.
The system currently treats them as perpetual until manually removed.

We need a job that runs EOD (End of Day) to identify expiring contracts.

Tasks:
- Create `SettlementService`.
- Identify positions in contracts expiring Today.
- For Cash-settled futures, calculate PnL against the settlement price and close position.
- For Physical-settled, trigger a notification (auto-exercise is out of scope for now).
