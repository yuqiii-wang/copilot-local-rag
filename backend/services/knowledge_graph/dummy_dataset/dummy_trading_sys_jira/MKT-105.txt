Key: MKT-105
Type: Story
Summary: Connect to new Bloomberg Feed Adapter
Status: Grooming
Priority: Low
Description:
The current random number generator in `SimplePricer` is not realistic enough for the QA team.
We have purchased a license for the B-PIPE adapter.

We need to implement `MarketDataSource` interface to consume the B-PIPE socket stream.

Technical Notes:
- The adapter provides prices for Equities and Futures.
- Options support is separate.
- Need to handle "Heartbeat" messages to detect disconnects.
