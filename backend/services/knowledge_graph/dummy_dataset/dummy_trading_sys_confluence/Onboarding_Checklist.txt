# Hello!
Welcome to the team. To get the `dummy-trading-system` running on your local machine, follow these steps.

# Prerequisites
1.  **Java JDK 17+**: We use modern records and switch expressions.
2.  **Maven 3.8+**: Build tool.
3.  **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA is recommended.

# First Run
1.  Clone the repo: `git clone ...`
2.  Navigate to `backend/services/knowledge_graph/dummy_dataset/dummy_trading_sys_java`.
3.  Run the tests to ensure environment is clean:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```
    *Note: You should see `EquityTest`, `BondTest`, etc. passing.*

# Common Issues
*   **"Security not found"**: Make sure you initialized the `DummyTestBase` or loaded the `DummySecuritiesLoading` helper if running main.
*   **"Borrow rate invalid"**: If you try to short sell without setting a borrow rate in `LendingService`, it defaults to rejection.

# Key Contacts
*   **Domain Expert**: Jane Doe (handling Options/Futures logic).
*   **Archiect**: John Smith (Core Engine).
