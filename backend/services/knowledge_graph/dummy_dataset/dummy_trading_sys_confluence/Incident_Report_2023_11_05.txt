# Summary
At 09:30 AM EST, the Trading System became unresponsive. 
Market Data updates stopped processing, and Order placement timed out.

# Root Cause
A JVM Garbage Collection (GC) "Stop-the-world" pause lasted for 45 seconds.
This was caused by the `DummyTradesLoading` class creating 10 million `Order` objects in a loop during a stress test that was accidentally run in the PROD environment configuration.

# Timeline
*   09:30:00 - Deployment of PR #123 (Performance Test).
*   09:30:15 - Memory usage spiked to 8GB (Heap Max).
*   09:30:20 - Full GC initiated.
*   09:31:05 - System recovered, but 500 orders were rejected by gateway timeouts.

# Action Items
1.  [High] Separate Prod and Test configurations strictly (Ticket OPS-122).
2.  [Medium] Optimize `Order` object memory footprint (maybe use flyweight pattern for Security references).
3.  [Low] Add alerting for GC pause times > 1s.
