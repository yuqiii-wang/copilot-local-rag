Title: Futures Roll Procedure

# Context
Futures contracts expire. For example, `ES-DEC24` expires in December 2024. Traders usually want to maintain exposure, so they "roll" the position to `ES-MAR25`.

# The Procedure (Manual)
1.  **Notification**: 3 days before expiry, the system sends an email listing all open positions in the expiring contract.
2.  **Close Leg**: Trader places a Market SELL order for the existing contract (e.g., Close 50 ES-DEC24).
3.  **Open Leg**: Trader places a Market BUY order for the next contract (e.g., Open 50 ES-MAR25).

# Automated Roll (Target State)
We want to build a "Roll" button in the UI.
*   **Action**: Atomic transaction creating two orders.
*   **Price**: Executed as a "Calendar Spread" if the exchange supports it, otherwise two legs.
*   **Risk**: The risk check should see this as a net-neutral risk event (delta remains similar), so we shouldn't block it on Gross Exposure if the temporary limits are tight.

# Reference
See JIRA Ticket: FUT-402 for settlement logic.
